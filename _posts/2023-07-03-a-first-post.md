What exactly makes a good blog? It seems like most of the blogs I visit are to answer a question. How do I cook X? What can I do about Y? How the hell do I make my code work? Lately, it seems I most commonly find myself on random SQL Server blogs, trying to figure out how to coax data out of the mess of a backend I've inherited at work. 

But does that make a good blog? I feel like readers invested in the author or a subject that can stretch on forever, like finance, probably make for the best blog. At least, the best monetization of a blog. But I care little about random people being invested in my life. And while I am interested in finance, my ego isn't big enough to think I should be the one giving advice.

The one personal thing I don't mind sharing is my love for and journey with code. And my  ~~journey~~ struggle with math. So in lieu of keeping my blog code, math, and personal free, I chose a blog based on Gitbooks. It looks simple, and I like it. The content means more then the look... I hope.

 Some things I could do to make it seem like I'm giving it my all

- Run post through LanguageTool (an open-source Grammarly!)
- Post regularly 
- Advertise somewhere when I have more than one post about how hard I'll try
