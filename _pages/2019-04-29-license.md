This blog layout was made by Tao He. The demo can be found [here](https://sighingnow.github.io/jekyll-gitbook/) and 
the github can be found [here](https://github.com/sighingnow/jekyll-gitbook). Between forking Tao's repo and the new github actions,
it only took me around 2 hours to get the blog up and running on both local and github pages. 
This is with autodeployent and tweaking the blog to be more customized!
