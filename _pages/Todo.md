Also I'm not running this page through Language Tool

My list of shame so everyone can see how much I'm slacking on blogging.
My hope is every post will be an example of a step taken toward my goals (listed below)

- [ ]  Read through Donald Knuths Books
- [ ]  Be able to understand Computer Science Research Papers

## Blog Stuff
-----
- [ ]  Take the hour or two to learn how to make markdown look nice
- [ ]  Create a workflow (Probably with obsdian?) to better note down stuff
- [ ]  Is there a better way to give categories
- [ ]  Related to above, can we use the home page to give categories and link to pages with liquid?
